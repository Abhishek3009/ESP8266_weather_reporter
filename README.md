# ESP8266_weather_reporter
IOT project using the NodeMCU esp8266 to gather weather data from https://openweathermap.org/ and displaying it on the OLED 128x64 display.

# NTP sever for date and time
To get time from an NTP Server, the ESP8266 needs to have an Internet connection and you donâ€™t need additional hardware (like an RTC clock). NTP stands for Network Time Protocol and it is a networking protocol for clock synchronization between computer systems. There are NTP servers like pool.ntp.org that anyone can use to request time as a client. In this case, the ESP8266 is an NTP Client that requests time from an NTP Server (pool.ntp.org).
