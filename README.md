# Openweathermap for current weather data
A free API key is provided when you create a free Openweathermap account which has few limitations but does the work. The account sign-up is free. The API keys can be managed on your account.
Access current weather data for any location on Earth including over 200,000 cities! We collect and process weather data from different sources such as global and local weather models, satellites, radars and a vast network of weather stations. Data is available in JSON, XML, or HTML format.

# NTP sever for date and time
To get time from an NTP Server, the ESP8266 needs to have an Internet connection and you donâ€™t need additional hardware (like an RTC clock). NTP stands for Network Time Protocol and it is a networking protocol for clock synchronization between computer systems. There are NTP servers like pool.ntp.org that anyone can use to request time as a client. In this case, the ESP8266 is an NTP Client that requests time from an NTP Server https://www.ntp.org/.
