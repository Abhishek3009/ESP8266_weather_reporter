# ICONS

The icons used are different from those on the https://openweathermap.org/. The icons selected are perfect for the single colour OLED display as those on the https://openweathermap.org/ require atleast 2 colours.
The C files contain the bitMap data for the icons and the icon is described by the name of the file.
